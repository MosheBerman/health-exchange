===============

A final project for professor Arnow's CISC 3140 class at Brooklyn College. Our team was assigned a "health care" website. 

Built by [@bermaniastudios](http://twitter.com/bermaniastudios), [@putmalk](http://twitter.com/putmalk), and a no-show.

Do what you wish so long as you:

1. Don't make money off of this. That wouldn't be fair to us.
2. Don't use this to cheat on any homework or exam. 
3. Don't use this to sign up for health care. We can't promise your safety if you do.
4. Attribute the original authors wherever you use our code.
5. Don't judge us by this code. It was a final project and we were having fun.
